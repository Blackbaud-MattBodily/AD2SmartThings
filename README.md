## AD2SmartThings v2.1
### ===================
### Integrate your Honeywell or Ademco alarm panel into your SmartThings physical graph
ADT / Honeywell / Ademco / Vista / Alarm / SmartThings / Alarm Panel / Home Alarm

Do want to integrate your home alarm panel with SmartThings?  Do you hate the hassle arming your panle and having to rush to disarm?  Do you want to install another keypad and don't want to deal with your alarm company?  Do you have an alarm panel and never use it?

This is a relatively simple integration project that effectively integrates your Honeywell or Ademco alarm panel with SmartThings.  These panels are typically installed by ADT or other alarm companies.  You can choose to continue or not with your ADT  monitoring service.  This project works either way.  

After installing this project, control of your alarm panel becomes intuitive and automagic!
* Automatically arm your panel after everyone has left the house, and have it disarm when you arrive.
* Use automation to turn on your alarm when you go to bed and turn off when you wake up 
* Control your alarm panel via your smartphone or a MiniMote or activate from other sensors or devices
* Use your smartphone or Minimote to send a panic alarm when there is danger.



***Release Note:***
*This release standardizes the hardware assembly of the AD2SmartThings device, which addresses the top two support issues.  The release includes a new Version 2.1 of the Arduino sketch and a new README with updated project instructions.  The release does not add any additional capabilities to Version 2.0 and uses the same Device Type.  If you already updated to Version 2.0 or recently completed the project, I don't see any reason to update.  However, if you still want to update, you simply reconfigure your hardware and update the Arduino sketch being sure to include the ST_Anything SmartThings library.  The libraries from SmartThings and the ArduinoMega library are not compatable with this Version 2.1 sketch. You must use the ST_Anything SmartThings library. A big thanks to Daniel Ogorchock and his son, Daniel Ogorchock, for creating a superior version of the SmartThings library with many enhancements and  full support for the Arduino Mega. This release is not backwards compatable with the Version 1.X device type.*

### Jumpers

For the wiring, I used individual male to male jumper cables to wire the project (see below).  I found these at Amazon such as **Male to Male Solderless Flexible Breadboard Jumper Cable Wires 65Pcs for Arduino by Sunkee**.

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/4343969/333ffca2-406d-11e4-95ef-287c4dfa869b.jpg" width="200px"  />


### Power Supplies
To power the ArduinoMega I used a 9V power supply to run the Arduino+ThingShield.  This was  purchased at Amazon as well by searching for "Arduino Power Supply".  Right now, I am using the Super Power Supply® AC / DC Adapter Charger Cord Plug - 9V 650mA compatible with Arduino Freeduino Duemilanove Uno Mega Hobby Electronics, which was available by Amazon Prime.   CAUTION: There are 9V power supplies availble on Amazon that do not work for the Arduino (they are made for musical instrament controllers) and some that perform very poorly on Arduino.  Be sure to read the reviews on Amazon to find an Arduino compatable power supply!  

### Project Housing
I simply strapped the Arduino onto a foam board and inserted it into my alarm panel box

## Constructing Your Project

### Wiring The Arduino Controller and Configuring The ThingShield

An **Arduino Mega* was used as the controller and was stacked with the SmartThings ThingShield.  

*Set the DIP switch on the ThingShield to D2/D3.*
The shield has a DIP switch that allows it to either read serial commands via pins 0/1 or pins 2/3. For this project, the ThingShield is reading the Serial commands from the ArduinoMega through the ThingShield pins 2/3. Check that the DIP switch is set to D2/D3.  Note, this is typically the default position when ThingShields are shipped. 

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/7670559/50d02238-fc6f-11e4-8208-3dadb582eb67.jpg" width="200px"  />   

Stack the ThingShield on top of the Arduino Mega, matching the pins as you push the two boards together.  All pins should be securely contacted.     

Use jumpers to provide a connection between Serial3 and Pins 2/3.  Here are the connections:

| Jumper     | Pin     | Pin     |
|:--------:|:------:|:-----:|
| RX         | 14      | 2       |
| TX         | 15      | 3       |

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/7666138/53eafdde-fb9e-11e4-92a1-c0b40a0e9001.jpg" width="400px"  />

Note, the ThingShield pins are not labeled.  So you can identify the pins using labels on the ArduinoMega picture (above) or by study the photos of my project (above).

### Wiring the AD2Pi to the Arduino/ThingShield

Here are the pin connections to make between the Arduino/Thingshield and the AD2Pi along with a couple pics to get you oriented.  You can make these connections using an 8" male to male jumper wire.

Pin Configuration for AD2Pi to Arduino Mega

|Jumper  | AD2PI  | Mega   |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| 3.3V   | 1      | 3.3V   |
| GND    | 6      | GND    |
| TX     | 8	    | 18     |

## The Software

The code for this project can be found posted on github:

https://github.com/d8adrvn/ad2smartthings.git

### Arduino Sketch 

To load the sketch onto the Arduino, you will need the Arduino developer environment:

http://arduino.cc/en/main/software

Once the software is installed, the first thing to do is obtain the required libraries.  

* Timer library was created by Simon Monk as modified by JChristensen.  A copy is included in this repository/release for your convenience.
* A copy of the SmartThings library contained in this repository/release.  This is the ST_Anything version of the SmartThings library.  The libraries from SmartThings and the SmartThingsMega libraries do not work.
* SoftwareSerial library was default library provided with Arduino IDE
 
Once you have the zip files downloaded you can import them within the Arduino IDE. Go to the Sketch:Import Library;Add Library drop down menu. Once you have added the libraries, they will show up under Sketch:Add Library:Contributed as "Timer" and "SmartThings".  Be sure the Timer library is installed and named: "Timer"

You can connect the Arduino Mega to your computer via an USB cable, create a new sketch, paste the code from github into the Arduino IDE and then transfer to the ArduinoMEGA.  Be sure to go to the tools menu, select <Board> and then select the ArduinoMega 2560 so that the code will compile correctly and not time out during transfer.  

Pairing instructions for the Arduino to the SmartThings hub can be found at SmartThings.com and are copied here:

“To join the shield to your SmartThings hub, go to “Add SmartThings” mode in the
SmartThings app by hitting the “+” icon in the desired location, and then press the Switch button on the shield. You should see the shield appear in the app.

To unpair the shield, press and hold the Switch button for 6 seconds and release. The shield will now be unpaired from your SmartThings Hub.”

Once you have finished transfering the code to the Arduino, you can remove the USB and power the Arduino using a 9V transformer.

Its more than a good idea to put a piece of electrical tape over the USB port to prevent accidental grounding of the port!

### Device Type Code 

The device type code allows you to control the ArduinoMega via the SmartThings physical graph.  The  controller device type code has the following features:

The Main Tile gives the status of the system and allows you to disarm the system (by pressing the tile).

Inside the device type:

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/6100596/3478d29e-afd8-11e4-9dfe-2945dfd7754a.PNG" width="200px"  />

* StatusTile -  Same as the main tile.  Shows status of system
* Disarm - disarms the system.  In case you accidently press the Panic key once or twice, and do not wish to activate a panic alarm, Disarm will reset the panic sequence.
* Stay - Activates the system in Stay node
* Away - Activates the system in Away mode
* Chime - toggles chime mode
* PANIC - a tile to activate the PANIC alarm.  To prevent false alrams, you must press this tile 3X. After pressing once, the tile will remind you to press twice more.  After pressing twice, the tile will remind you to press once more.  After pressing a thrid time, the PANIC alarm will sound.  Note, for this to work, you must set the Preferences to indicate which Panic code has been configured for your alarm.  If in doubt, try "B".  And test the system!
*Preferences - allows you to set various preferences.  You must enter your homeowner security code and you must select one of three choices for the Panic code.  
* Message Tile - displays all the messages sent from the AD2Pi

* Preferences - This allows you to configure the device type for your alarm panel.  You must enter your 4 digit homeowners alarm access code.  For the PANIC tile to work, you must select one of the three choices for your Panic code. This code must be valid for your system.  If in doubt, try "B" and then test your system

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/6100607/4f67cdee-afd8-11e4-88ff-6df233021bb9.PNG" width="200px"  />

* Configure AD2Pi - this tile sends configuration commands to AD2Pi.  Enter the command in the Preferences section and then send the command to the AD2Pi by pressing this tile.  The main purpose is to set the AD2Pi with a valid address.  

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/6100610/67d0130a-afd8-11e4-89e6-4f03e2801406.PNG" width="200px"  />


* Zones - there are status tiles for up to 36 zones.  If you need fewer zones, you can simply trim the number of zones displayed by modifying the <details> command in the code.  Its that simple.   

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5625006/6100601/47d9f9b2-afd8-11e4-8151-a38d3ad222e0.PNG" width="200px"  />


To install the device type code: 

1.  Go to graph.api.smartthings.com   
2.  Select My Device Types tab
3.  Select the +NewSmartDevice button
4.  Choose "From Code" tab
5.  Paste the device type code from this repository
6.  Go to the line of code with the "details" arguments
7.  Edit the number of zones in the details argument list to match the number of zones in your system.
8.  Save and Publish (for me) the device type.  You have to Publish!
9.  Go to My Devices tab 
10.  Select your Arduino and using the drop down, select your newly created AD2SmartThings device type (v2 or later).
11.  Go to your mobile device and the Arduino tile should now display as a Home Alarm tile.  Hint: on the iPhone, sometimes you have to kill the SmartThings app two times before a new device type update will display on the SmartThings iPhone app.

## Connect Your Project To Your Alarm Panel

### Wiring The AD2Pi to your Honeywell or Ademco alarm panel

There is excellent documentation on the Alarm Decoder web site, including an instructional video.  Look for instructions on how to wire the AD2USB which are the same instructions for the AD2Pi used in this project.  Here is the URL:

http://www.alarmdecoder.com/wiki/index.php/Panel_Configuration

### Configuring Your System To Work With Vista10SE or other SE-series
The VistaSE series requires the AD2Pi to be configured with an ADDRESS=31.   To do this, go to the Preferences tile on your mobile device and in the Configuration box, enter "ADDRESS=31".  All caps, no spaces and no quotes.  After entering this in the Preferences, you must then press the Config AD2Pi tile to send down the configuration command to the AD2Pi.  You will see the Message tile indicate !Sending and then you should see a confirmation message of "ADDRESS=31".  You can double check your work by going back to the Preferences, erasing the command (recommended) and then pressing the ConfigAD2Pi tile once again.  The Message tile will report back the current address of the AD2Pi.  

### Configuring Your System To Work With Vista 20P or other P-series
The Vista20P will only commuicate to the AD2Pi if it has been properly configured with a unique address.  This requires two steps.  First, you need to activate an unused keypad address in your Vista20P and second, you need to configure the AD2Pi with that address.

To configure your Vista20P, follow the instructions in the manual to activate an unused keypad address.  There is a helpful video at alarmdecoder.com  http://www.alarmdecoder.com/wiki/index.php/Panel_Configuration   You can also find a manual at  http://site.aesecurity.com/Manuals/v15pand20pprogrammingguide.pdf

You will also may need to configure the AD2Pi.  The AD2Pi is pre-configured with ADDRESS=18.  If you were lucky enough to only have two keypads and activated the third keypad for the AD2Pi (*191 in the Honeywell programming mode), then you should be fine.  If you activated a different keypad, lets say keypad #4 (*192), then you need to configure the AD2Pi with the correct address.  For Keypad #4, you should configure with ADDRESS=19.  To do this, go to the Preferences tile on your mobile device and in the Configuration box, enter "ADDRESS=19".  All caps, no spaces and no quotes.  After entering this in the Preferences, you must then press the Config AD2Pi tile to send down the configuration command to the AD2Pi.  You will see the Message tile indicate !Sending and then you should see a confirmation message of "ADDRESS=19".  You can double check your work by going back to the Preferences, erasing the command (recommended) and then pressing the ConfigAD2Pi tile once again.  The Message tile will report back the current address of the AD2Pi.  

## Integration of Home Alarm Into Automated Actions:

The device type also establishes a switch and lock capability.  You can integrate your alarm panel into SmartApps and into Actions using these capabilities.

To automate turning on/off the Alarm in "Stay" mode, select the Home Alarm from the list of "switches" in your SmartThings device list

To To automate turning on/off the Alarm in "Away" mode, select the Home Alarm from the list of "locks" in your SmartThings device list.  "Locking" the alarm turns it on in Away Mode while "Un-Locking" turns it off

Have fun integrating!

## FAQs

* After installing the Device Type, be sure to both Save AND Publish (for me).  If you do not publish, they will not be able to communicate with the hub.  If you make changes to either code, Publish early and often to avoid IDE issues.

* The Arduino 9V power supply (transformer) can be purchased at Amazon by searching for "Arduino Power Supply".  CAUTION: There are 9V power supplies availble on Amazon that do not work for the Arduino (they are made for musical instrament controllers) and some that perform very poorly on Arduino.  Be sure to read the reviews!  

* If you have hooked up everything "perfectly", and you still do not see any communication from the AD2Pi, recheck the following:
  *   Have you set the ThingShield DIP to D0/D1?
  *  Did you configure the AD2Pi with a valid address?  For a Vista SE series, set AD2Pi to ADRESS=31.  For Vista P series, set the address corresponding to the keypad address that you activated on your alarm keypad.  Use the mobile phone device Preferences to submit the address change information and press the <configure> tile to download the address change to the AD2Pi.  Be sure to press <configure>
  *   If you have a Vista P series, did you activate an extra keypad address for the AD2Pi to use
  *   The AD2Pi LED is blinking steadily.  If not, recheck the AD2Pi wiring diagram from alarmdecoder.com
  *   You pressed PUBLISH (for me) after creating your device-type on graph.api.smartthings.com
* While compiling or transferring the code, you get the following error: 'Serial1' was not declared in this scope or  'Serial2' was not declared in this scope, then you likely do not have the correct board selected in the Arduino Development Environment.  You can also have the same issue if you see that during transfer, the transfer process times out without transfering the code.  Go to the <Tools> menu and select <Board> then select the Mega 2560.  This will allow the code to compile correctly.
